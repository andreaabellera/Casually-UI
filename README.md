## Pick what you need
Save the bundle space when you can!  
Components in this collection can be individually linked or imported. Visit the component subdirectories for Usage guides.

- [**casually-box**](/casually-box) - A sleek container that will center or evenly align anything you place inside it in your desired orientation.
  
- [**casually-button**](/casually-button) - If for any reason, you don't want a rectangular or round-edged button, you can have a hex or rhombus. Add to that a classy, subtle gradient animation on focus, and cool borders. There's no forced conversion to the edgy button gang, but we will let you ponder and decide.

- [**casually-card**](/casually-card) - Designed with images and content in mind, a card has two features - an image reserve and a slot that can take anything. You may make use of both and orient your image from any direction, or use one of either to make a simple image or content frame. Pass a link prop to turn your card into a hyperlink.

- [**custom-emoji**](/custom-emoji) - Inspired by Discord emojis, a custom emoji is a small image inline to a paragraph or heading text. Pass an image url source or a preset ID to pick from our meme collection.

- [**social-link-button**](/social-link-button) - Social link in, fully-embellished button out. Social links are a staple in portfolios and business websites. They are hefty to set up, but not anymore. This component will provide the styles and a quality SVG logo for a link prop.


## Take the collection
If you intend to use more components, Casually UI has a one-shot import. Like children, all you'll need is to remember their tag names.

### Link to HTML file
Attach this script within the `<head>` or `<body>` scope in standalone HTML files, cross-language net frameworks, or when NPM import fails.

    <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/casually-ui@latest/index.js"></script>

### Install from NPM
Install `casually-ui` with any NodeJS framework (e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, Angular) or ES architecture that uses NPM.  

    npm i casually-ui

Import and all components in this repository are ready to go! No need to declare modules internally.

    import 'casually-ui'
